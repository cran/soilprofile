Description: This package provides functions to graphically represent 
	     soil properties. Morphological data gathered in the field 
	     such as horizon boundaries, root abundance and dimensions,
	     skeletal shape, abundance and dimension as well as	
	     meaningful soil color may be represented via the plot
	     function. A lattice-based plot.element function has been 
	     designed to represent depth function of a given variable.
Depends: R (>= 2.14.1), aqp, lattice, munsell, splancs, methods
